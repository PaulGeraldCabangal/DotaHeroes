        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Abaddon, the Lord of Avernus, is a melee strength hero known as one of the most versatile characters in Dota due to his rather low mana dependence, short spell cooldowns and a large number of viable item choices. His ability to help sustain his allies and himself plus his strong tower diving capacity give him solid lane presence.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Razzil Darkbrew, the Alchemist, is a melee strength hero whose alchemical prowess makes him a strange but versatile fighter. He is an unusual carry based upon transmuting killed creeps into large amounts of bonus gold, with both an early game and late game presence due to the enormous health regeneration from his ultimate and the first strike nature of his other spells. His low but balanced attributes and the sure promise of gold for items means he can be one of the most disparately built heroes in the game. </p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Axe is commonly played as an initiator, as his potent disables can disrupt the enemy's formation and give his team openings in fights. Axe's fighting style demands that he gets up close and very personal, as he can taunt enemies into attacking him with Berserker's Call, preventing them from engaging his teammates and granting him a huge amount of bonus armor.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Karroch, the Beastmaster, is a versatile melee strength hero most commonly played as an offlaner and ganker who brings a good amount of utility to his team in any situation. His Wild Axes allows him to lane and farm quite effectively throughout the game, even when pressured. He is able to summon a hawk and boar to aid him, each providing a good amount of utility to his team. </p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Rigwarl, the Bristleback, is a melee strength hero famous for his array of synergistic, simplistic, and yet effective spells with low mana costs and cooldowns. Though each cast of his spells has relatively weak potency on its own, their instances have a cumulative effect, making the Bristleback quite deadly the longer he stays alive in a fight; this is directly reflected in his ultimate, Warpath, which powers up his movement and attack damage based on the number of spells he recently cast.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Chaos Knight is a melee strength hero with one of the highest physical damage output ceilings of all heroes. He is mostly played as a carry and ganker. As his name implies, he has a theme based on randomness and uncertainty. His regular attack has an incredibly wide thirty damage spread, making his last hitting ability somewhat unreliable. Chaos Bolt is his most notorious luck-based ability which, at max level, can stun a target anywhere between a mediocre 2 seconds to an effective 4 seconds that will almost certainly assure the target's death. </p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Mangix, the Brewmaster, is a melee strength hero that can fill almost any role, though he is primarily seen as a carry, ganker, tank or initiator. He fits well into any lane, but is very experience dependent, which means he is often seen on the offlane or the midlane. His core abilities make him a respectable physical damage dealer and an especially good duelist since he has abilities that involve negating opposing attacks while strengthening his own.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Bradwarden, the Centaur Warrunner, is a melee strength hero whose natural place in combat is right in the center of battle. His abilities stop enemies around him in their tracks and inflict heavy damage, making him an excellent initiator. He is also a powerful tank, having the highest strength gain in the game. </p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Rattletrap, the Clockwerk, is a melee strength hero known as being one of the most well-rounded initiator-gankers in the game. Rattletrap's wide array of disables and nukes allows him to cause chaos among the enemy team and break up their formation, giving his team a powerful advantage in any fight.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">
          Lucifer, the Doom, is a melee strength hero with strong farming capabilities, good versatility, and one of the strongest single-target disables in the game. His very low starting armor makes him vulnerable to harassment, but his abilities and high health allow him to lane or even jungle quite effectively. A ruthless demon, Doom possesses malicious abilities revolving around greed, fire, and death. His Devour ability allows him to consume creeps, granting regeneration to offset harassment, providing additional gold and allowing him to absorb their powers, using them to increase his own strength. </p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Davion, the Dragon Knight, is a durable melee strength hero with a relatively straightforward and yet versatile skill set. He has both an area-of-effect nuke and a lengthy single-target stun, giving him excellent farming and ganking capabilities. Though he has no real escape ability, his Dragon Blood provides him a hefty amount of armor and regen, making him capable of withstanding strong physical hits and recovering quickly. He is still very vulnerable in the early game, however, and needs to farm and stay alive in order to be effective in later stages.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">
          Kaolin, the Earth Spirit, is a melee strength hero with great utility, possessing a wide array of disables in all of his basic abilities.

Unlike most heroes, his abilities revolve around an innate ability, Stone Remnant, which allows him to place statues that can be used to augment his abilities. Using his abilities in tandem with these remnants, Earth Spirit can slow enemies with Boulder Smash, stun them and initiate with Rolling Boulder, and silence them with Geomagnetic Grip. His ultimate, Magnetize, inflicts nearby enemies with a damage over time debuff, and allows him to spread the slow and silence from his abilities to other nearby enemies</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Raigor Stonehoof, the Earthshaker, is a melee strength hero with several area of effect (AoE) disables, commonly played as a ganker or initiator. Good usage of his spells allow him to damage and chainstun multiple enemies at once, making him very disruptive in skirmishes and teamfights. His Fissure is a versatile long-ranged spell that affects enemies in a line, used to stun, inflict moderate damage, and create an impassable wall of earth for a significant duration. Proper usage of this can allows him to cut off chokepoints, leaving enemies with no escape routes or preventing them from chasing after endangered allies.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">
          The Elder Titan is a melee strength hero who is renowned as a powerful area nuker and disabler.

          Elder Titan is perhaps best known for his ability Astral Spirit, which sends forth an image of himself that damages enemies that it passes through, and upon returning to Elder Titan boosts his attack damage and movement speed, making him a fearsome melee fighter. Possessing a channeled sleep in Echo Stomp, Elder Titan is also capable of knocking out his foes for an extended period of time if they are caught within its radius; Astral Spirit also allows him to cast this ability and disable large groups of enemies from afar, making him one of the few initiators that does not require a Blink Dagger. This combination creates a perfect setup for his powerful ultimate Earth Splitter</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Huskar, the Sacred Warrior, is a ranged strength hero who is an effective ganker and carry, with both great benefits and risks offered. He is known to be a powerful adversary in most games because his damage-per-second attacks can easily kill almost all heroes at any point in the game, assuming no one is nearby to save them. Unlike many other heroes, Huskar does not require much mana to use his abilities; rather, he sacrifices his own health to inflict additional damage. His passive, Berserker's Blood, defines the power of sacrifice: Huskar gets more dangerous the more he gets hurt.

With its support-oriented skill set, Io can share its healing and buffs through Tether and Overcharge, harass enemy heroes out of the lane with Spirits, and materialize itself and an ally anywhere on the map with Relocate.
