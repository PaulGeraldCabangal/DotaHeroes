        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition, is a ranged intelligence hero who is usually played as a support. Though frail, this icy elemental caster possesses strong semi-spammable spells and a painful global ultimate. Cold Feet harms enemies and will also stun them unless they move away from the cast area, making the spell dangerous when used in conjunction with disables from allies. Ice Vortex is a low-cooldown zoning ability, applying a heavy slow and magic damage amplification to nearby enemies.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Atropos, the Bane Elemental (or simply Bane), is a ranged intelligence hero whose dark and nightmarish abilities give him prowess as a disabler, ganker, and nuker. Mostly played as a support, his high starting stats make him a menace in lane. Bane possesses one passive spell and three potent single-target spells, which must be used well to make up for his lack of pushing power or area of effect presence. Bane's passive spell, Enfeeble, reduces the target's status resistance and magic resistance.</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Batrider is a ranged intelligence hero who excels at initiation and harassing enemies. He is a mobile raider capable of dealing enormous amounts of damage, though he must close in on targets to pull it off. Batrider begins by spraying areas with Sticky Napalm, a stacking debuff useful for hindering enemies or gaining vision. In order to get a better view he activates Firefly, leaving a burning trail of liquid fire that scorches those who dare cross his path. Now able to cross through previously impassable terrain Batrider has free reign to decide how to continue his reign of terror.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Chen, the Holy Knight, is a ranged intelligence hero, whose signature ability, Holy Persuasion, allows him to take control of creeps. Commanding them well requires adept micromanagement and map awareness, but once mastered Chen becomes an effective ganker and one of the game's strongest early pushers. His ability to convert creeps makes it natural for him to spend the laning phase as a jungler, emerging to pick off enemies with his creep army's array of disables. </p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Rylai, the Crystal Maiden, is a ranged intelligence hero who uses the power of frost and ice to disable and dispatch her foes. A slow and fragile support, Crystal Maiden's strength lies in her battery of strong nukes, disables and slows. Crystal Nova is an area-of-effect nuke that slows enemies' attack and movement speeds, while Frostbite immobilizes an enemy in a block of ice, dealing moderate damage per second.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Ish'kafel, the Dark Seer, is a melee intelligence hero who relies on his abilities' potent utility and synergy. In lane he is sustained by high armor and enabled by his Ion Shell and Surge. Surge boosts his or an ally's speed, helping them to escape or pursue opponents. Ion Shell wraps a unit in a spiky shield that rapidly damages nearby enemies, enabling Ish'kafel to harass and gain last hits.</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Mireska Sunbreeze, the Dark Willow, is a ranged intelligence hero with a powerful array of disables and nukes. She can summon a tangle of thorns to root enemies in her Bramble Maze, or curse an enemy to stun them after a delay with Cursed Crown. Slipping into the Shadow Realm to avoid attacks, she re-emerges with a powerful magical burst. Calling upon her companion Jex, Dark Willow dishes out a flurry of heavy magic damage with Bedlam.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Dazzle, the Shadow Priest, is a ranged intelligence hero who conjures dazzling dark light to heal his allies and prevent their deaths. His Shadow Wave is a low-cooldown nuke and chain healing ability, dealing more damage to nearby enemies for each ally the wave heals. Shallow Grave makes an ally temporarily unkillable, allowing Dazzle's teammates to survive impossible situations. Poison Touch is a spammable ability that slows its target and deals damage over time.</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Krobelus, the Death Prophet, is a ranged intelligence hero who excels at pushing lanes. She is often played in the mid lane, since her Crypt Swarm gives her strong magic damage that can be spammed to her heart's content. As she levels her ultimate, Exorcism, Death Prophet can deal a huge amount of damage to towers and heroes alike, while healing at the end of the duration.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">
          Disruptor, the Stormcrafter, is a ranged intelligence hero who requires good positioning to use his abilities effectively. His signature ability is Kinetic Field, a pseudo-disable that traps enemies within a small area for a long duration. Combined with his Static Storm, Disruptor can act as the initiator for a teamfight, or supplement his teammates' initiation very well. Glimpse is another powerful spell that forces enemies to watch their movements, as Disruptor can easily drag them back to a previous location to be focused down.</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Aiushtha, the Enchantress, is a ranged intelligence hero who uses her abilities to push through lanes and gank with relative ease. Enchantress works well as a jungler in the early game, as it maximizes the effectiveness of her Enchant and Untouchable abilities. On first glance, she may be just a support, serving her allies with powerful heals, creep abilities and slows.

          Enigma is a ranged intelligence hero who uses his abilities to cripple his enemies, supported by a seemingly inexhaustible army of creeps. His fearsome abilities can bind entire teams under his might. Enigma is also a formidable jungler and pusher owing to his ability to create creeps.</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Grimstroke is a ranged intelligence hero specializing as a nuker and offensive support. With an arsenal of punitive and disabling spells, he forces enemies to rethink their actions, or retreat from his overbearing attacks. His long cast range also allows him to harass and zone out opponents while delivering substantial damage from the back line.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">
          Carl, the Invoker, is a ranged intelligence hero who is very difficult to master. He is unique in that he possesses a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of them - Quas, Wex, and Exort - are reagents and one is his special ultimate Invoke. The three abilities he learns throughout leveling up can have three instances, which serve as the basic ingredients or components for him to create a new ability using his ultimate. Once the reagents or elements are combined, he can invoke one out of ten different abilities. All of his invoked abilities are capable of a multitude of actions, from damaging enemies to aiding his allies, and even saving himself from danger.</p>

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: center;">Ezalor, the Keeper of the Light, is a ranged intelligence hero famous for his reputation as a one-man support team. Supporting his allies in need, and pushing unguarded lanes with ease, Ezalor is a very valuable ally for any team. Having a variety of useful abilities, he can channel a powerful globe of intense light that can heavily damage an army of enemy creeps in the lane, allowing for an easy push. He can also restore mana and reduce cooldown for himself and his allies as well as blind his enemies with an intense light that also damages and displaces them.
